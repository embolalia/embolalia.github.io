The Nephew of Sam[^1] is to awake from his sleep on 6/7[^2]. He will bear a staff wrapped with a serpent[^3], and walk upon the water[^4] of the great River Xudzon. In a rainstorm, he will strike the water with his staff, and it will turn to poison. All the fish will die, and it will bear an awful stench.[^5] But after three days, it will become water again.[^6] The fish will return, and their curse will be not from the spirit of the river, but from the war crimes of General Electric.[^7]

The Nephew of Sam will then travel south, to the New Zuider Zee.[^8] When he puts his staff in the waters, they will part.[^9] He will banish all the evil devils to New Jersey, and the self-righteous knicks to New York,[^10] and he will stand on dry land in the middle.[^11] When he removes his staff, the waters will come together again.[^12]

[^1]: not to be confused with the Son of Sam
[^2]: my birthday, coincidentally
[^3]: The Rod of Asclepius®, symbol of Medicine™
[^4]: on a floating dock, anyway
[^5]: if I believe my father, the smell is normal and not bad
[^6]: medicine says it'll only make healthy people sick because of CSO, and that danger passes after two or three days
[^7]: GE dumped pollutants that make the fish unsafe for young and old people
[^8]: New York harbor
[^9]: the border lines will be shown
[^10]: the New Jersey Devils and New York Knicks are sports teams
[^11]: the New Jersey part of Ellis Island
[^12]: it's all a federal waterway and national park, so the line on the map isn't really relevant anyway
