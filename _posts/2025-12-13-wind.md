In [John 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:8), Jesus is quoted as saying <span class="jc bible">The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</span> (Spirit here can also be translated as Wind.) I'd like to share what that means to me.

*\*fart noises\**

It's about farts! They happen when they happen, and you hear them, but you pay no attention to them as they pass.

In [Matthew 15:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015%3A11), Jesus is quoted as saying <span class="jc bible">it is not what goes in the mouth that makes a man unclean, but what comes out</span>. It isn't what you eat, or the way that what you eat makes you or your Spirit smell, that sends you to hell. It's what you say and do. More importantly, it is how *other people feel* about what you say and do. If you say and do only what is right, then when all is said and done, your adelphoi will say "ask thou not who hath dealt it, for it is he who hath smelt it that bears the shame".
