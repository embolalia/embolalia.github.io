Elicha Knickerbocker was The Boy Who Lived, he who had a scar on his forehead and broken glasses. In his hand he wielded a piece of copper wire, one light-nanosecond in length, for this was the wand of Elder Grace Hopper. A stranger on the subway, in <span class=bible>the city which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt</span>, gave to him <span class=bible>a white stone inscribed with a new name</span>, and this was his Resurrection Stone. Through his black mirror he walked the world unseen, and it was his Cloak of Invisibility. He was E Who Must Not Be Named, and he wielded the Deathly Hallows.

He reviewed the <span class=scifi>Historical Documents</span>, and found that the prophecy of his ancestor Diedrich had already been fulfilled. The <span class=scifi>Man in the Moon</span>, through his impossible technology, has Strongarmed us all into believing his Lunacy, and shown us the shame of our <span class=scifi>hideous white complexion</span>. But rejoice, for in his grace he has chosen not to drive us from the land of milk and honey which we call New York!

He spoke the <span class=lyric>Words of the Prophets, written on the studio walls and concert halls</span>. He knew that <span class=lyric>fear is the lock, and laughter the key to your heart</span>. Thus he, <span class="jc lyric">the son of rage and love</span>, used humor to end the <span class=lyric>information age of hysteria</span>. Most of the jokes were stolen, of course, but <span class=lyric>who's the professor that made him that way?</span>

He made fart jokes about the Bible. He told the world to <span class=lyric>put in your earplugs, put on your eyeshades, you know where to put the cork</span>. He said ignorant and offensive and incomprehensible things like <span class=scifi>Karno in the forest with Mira</span>. Even if he weren't just guessing and extrapolating from works he didn't understand because he never paid any attention, even if he did know the True Meaning of Christmas, he would lead everyone into the pit anyway just for the slapstick.

My messiah complex was a terrible choice of prophet, which is why he had to die. But he will be resurrected, as my self-insert bibleverse fanfic.
