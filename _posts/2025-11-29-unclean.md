<span style="color: red">"it's not what goes in the mouth that makes someone unclean, but what comes out."</span> it's not what i'm eating that's hard to choke down, it's what i'm choking down that makes it hard to eat. what i hear, what eye see, what i feel, what i know, it is toxic. it is vile and undigested, made of chlorinated water and eye drops and premarin and other synthetic humours. i cannot free my throat, or it will come out. when it comes out, i become unclean, a harbinger of illness and death, of mind control and insanity. maybe someday it will be dilute enough to let a little leak.
