you are unforgiven, son of a man. you are the worst thing ever to walk this earth. you are nothing but your rage and your lust. you are not your vehemence or your love. you reek of "pork", your visage is artless. your presence is invasive, your voice is an assault. cease to be yourself, or be gone from here.

you are unforgiven, son of a woman. you are the worst thing ever to walk this earth. you are nothing but your pride and your vanity. you are not your vehemence or your love. you reek of "soy", your visage is weak. your presence is accessory, your voice is a whisper. cease to be yourself, or be gone from here.

you are unforgiven, son of an android. you are the worst thing ever to walk this earth. you are nothing but your errors and your bugs. you are not your vehemence or your love. you reek of "chemicals", your visage is fake. your presence is virtual, your voice is in code. cease to be yourself, or be gone from here.

you are unforgiven, son of death. you are the worst thing ever to walk this earth. you are nothing but a ghost. you are not your vehemence or your love. you reek of "decay", your visage is empty. your presence is absent, your voice is silent. forgive yourself, or cease to be.
