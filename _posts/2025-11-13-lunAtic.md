```
acid rain torments my eyes
my lungs breathe only smoke
mem'ry lost but bringing pain
is that on which i choke

drowning in the open air
not knowing what to grieve
broken eyes are fixed to stare
and granted no reprieve 

find me now behind the moon
washed in lunAtic light
voiceless singing out of tune
giraffes my only sight
```
