i have seen the light. i have had the light forced into my eyes like so many needles. i have felt the sunlight, and it burned me. i have felt the limelight, and it proved me a fool. i have seen the red, the green, and the blue, and they were unreal.

tonight i see the glory of the gloom. can you forgive me for being now a child of the dark? if it makes me a witch who must not be suffered to live, i welcome death. if it makes me the antichrist, i welcome crucifixion. i would rather share my peace, but those who never put out their fires prefer war.
