when i say what i see, it has consequences. horrible, painful consequences. if i don't describe it right, if i get it wrong, if i say it exactly the right way and it just doesn't come across right… maybe i'm lucky and it only hurts me. usually it only hurts me. i feel embarrassed, maybe get a bad prescription. but <span class=lyric>bodies break with sticks and stones</span> <span class=pua></span>

the vast majority of the time, i see in a fairly normal way. my right eye just feels like peripheral vision. sometimes, several times a day when i'm stressed, my vision splits. the exact way the two images show up on top of each other… i can't make words of it. i don't think it matters. i waste hours obsessing over it, trying to see what my eyes do, how they work, whether i can reconcile them. i want to just stop. i don't want to care. i want to let them be what they are. i don't think my soul will ever let me.

the left eye works how i imagine everyone else's does, but the right eye… as i adjust its focus, the image shifts. it moves, a little to the right, i think? but it stays in once place as it moves. it twists, clockwise, just a couple degrees. it stretches, from the bottom left to the top right. but it stays in place as it stretches. it's not in focus, but sometimes, for fleeting moments, it seems like it is.

but the optics are only one part of what i see. when i explore my vision, i can make words jump off the screen, or objects disappear, or darken a room. in exceedingly rare moments of horrible stress, triggered in just the wrong way, i have had all the Giraffes disappear, leaving a perfectly clear image with nothing identifiable in it.

then there's the feelings. electricity and pressure and pain and wind and fear and fear and fear. a feeling of my soul dropping back from the glasses into the retina. and the metaphors. Giraffes and prophecies and omens, real until i realize they're not. cryptic, too open to interpretation to be interpretable, but it's safer that way. and more. always more. always something i'm seeing but can't see, always something indescribable or Unspeakable. all the things that make me want to hide, to curl up and close my eyes tight, and never see or be seen again.
