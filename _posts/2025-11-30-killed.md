Eye killed God. im the reason The church is gone. it started struggling when my eye started going, and it closed just as i would have been confirmed. it was because of me, faithlessly pretending medicine was what fixed my vision. faithlessly thinking my vision needed fixing. faithlessly failing to… communicate. speak the Unspeakable. connect the dots. spot the difference. im choked up. theres water in my nose. none of it means anything. excuses. i deserve all the fire and brimstone ive gotten. i give it to myself.

but isnt someone supposed to leave the 99 to find the one? where did my faithlessness come from? whatever. maybe the subliminal mindfuck america got into everyones heads, and we all sang the hymn, 🎶i dont care if you dont / i dont care if you dont / i dont care if you dont care🎶
