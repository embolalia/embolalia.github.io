oh "Geometric Mouse, Variation Ⅰ"
your eyes are so gently chained
so readily removed
that first link slides apart so easily

the places I could take you
the things you could see
I could take you to the River
to the Church in which I worship

I could show you what else I see around you
you know the Plaza, you know the Egg, you are the Art
but do you know the memorial well?
that sequestered somber silence?
do you know the grove?
that shady corner where the trees aren't square?
do you know the bus station below?
that forgotten hub of an imagined network?
do you know the millennial garage?
that extension of wretched suburbanity?

I could show you all this and more
return your eyes before anyone notices their absence
such gentle vandalism
but you, dear mouse, are not who needs to See
