While spelunking in a cave in the Adirondacks, <span class=mormon>it came to pass</span> that Elicha found a well-hidden crevice, into which was tucked a stack of paper plates. On these paper plates was scrawled a missing gospel, written in a language only their discoverer could read, as is traditionally the case. They showed me the plates, and I can indeed confirm that the markings on them were thoroughly illegible, though the same could be said of Elicha's English handwriting, to which the markings bore a striking similarity. When I remarked that the pattern of teal and purple around the edges of the plates gave me the sense that they were of approximately the same vintage as my millennial self, they assured me that the 90s in which the plates were created were those which occurred approximately a century after the birth of Jesus, rather than those nearly two millennia later, and that the similar pattern was merely an example of the cyclical nature of aesthetic trends. I was suspicious that paper could be so old, thinking it was rather a more recent invention, but a quick check of Wikipedia confirmed that the earliest known paper was indeed produced several centuries prior to the provenance of the plates, albeit in China, and using hemp rather than the wood pulp used in the Adirondack paper industry. The medium was thus unconcerning, though I wondered how the artifacts had survived so long in an environment rather less hospitable to archival preservation than the arid climates which enabled the longevity of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Elicha assured me that the cave was in a part of the range where <span class=lyric>there ain't no snow, the rain don't fall, and the wind don't blow</span>. When I questioned how such a place could possibly persist in so prodigiously precipitatious a province as New York, they simply responded "<span class="ek meme">shun the non-believer</span>".
