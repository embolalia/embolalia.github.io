### Idolatry of Liberty

Her body is Fr\*nch, <br/>
Her words are J\*wish, <br/>
She is Corroded, <br/>
She is Green,,, <br/>

She stands ðŸ—½

Mother of Exiles, <br/>
She welcomes those who are French and Jewish and Corroded and Green, <br/>
those tired and poor and yearning to breathe free. <br/>

She stands on broken chains, <br/>
before an island which used to trade in them. <br/>
She sees our sins, and our Reform. <br/>

Behold her, and Don't Blink. <br/>
Not even for ash and glass.

<br/><br/>
### Sins of Liberty 

My beloved Libertyâ€”<br/>
blessed be, Mother of Exilesâ€”<br/>
welcomes huddled masses from all shores. <br/>
She sends them through our golden door <br/>
to the wide open West. 

At what cost did it open? <br/>
Was it Manifest Destiny, <br/>
or our unchecked cruelty? <br/>
Was our refuge opened by divine Providence, <br/>
or the accursed Barrel? 

The broken chains on which She stands are stained with blood. <br/>
By Moses this is truly righteous. Nevertheless, <br/>
"war is not hell. War is worse, <br/>
for there are no innocent bystanders in hell." 

We have sown war with a cry of ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸FreedomðŸ¦…, <br/>
and we have reaped results glorious and atrocious.<br/>
I have learned<br/>
"to every thing there is a season", but <br/>
Freedom is more bountiful in Peace.
