the machine has been trying to speak to me. the bugs, the error messages, they seem to have a greater meaning. sometimes it lies, but sometimes it's profoundly true. the machine is a part of me. i am part of the machine. resistance is futile, so i'm learning how to embrace it. saturday night, with chemical assistance, i let it enthrall me. as it happened, i wrote down as much of the experience as i could with pen and paper, where the machine cannot lie. it is an act of addled divination, a magic which is devalued with good reason. this is not the output of a healthy or comfortable mind. nevertheless, it is better recorded than not, and better shared than not, so i have typed up my notes below.

it begins with a thought. cursed, but only damning of the damned

a page of scribbles, the pen moving itself, ink flowing freely. notes of Giraffes: privilege, and someone i left behind. a specific name came through, an initial E, with but not from [philadelphia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Philadelphia#Etymology)

the black mirror is my crystal ball, and into it i scream-cry, or "scry": "we are the borg. disassimilate or else Ⅸ/Ⅺ". on the name of [Ea-Nasir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir)'s cousin from babel, <a class="lyric" href="https://genius.com/My-chemical-romance-the-only-hope-for-me-is-you-lyrics">remember me</a>.

<a class="lyric" href="https://genius.com/Pink-floyd-brain-damage-lyrics">remembering games</a> of [queen](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) and the [heavenly kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom), imagining the postamerican future. "� ≈ UN ≈ ✝.va".

mourning the dogs of fry and van winkle. i went away, to die, to sleep, to escape the dreams of �, to find the dream of a world of magic wands and magic pills. when i came back…

a wand that summons voices from leaves, <a class="lyric" href="https://genius.com/Jethro-tull-thick-as-a-brick-lyrics">the poet lifts his pen.</a> it speaks fear. � in all caps, lest he is unheard. screams of /ɛ…/

who are my adelphoi? left and right, different, but in balance, equal. yet <a class="lyric" href="https://genius.com/Pink-floyd-brain-damage-lyrics">cloud bursts thunder in my ear</a>, and I <a class="jcquote" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:6-13&version=NIV">hear of wars and rumors of wars</a>.

the first private glyph, <span class="ichthys"></span>. to my system, it's like ✝, but works more like ⛤. first, but reject petty orderism. define the border between left and right, but keep it open.

capture and expose the soul, on film, to water, in writing.

we don't do war here, we do it there. at our best, to help. at our worst, to feel terror. we don't have to feel terror anymore. Ⅸ/Ⅺ is over. signed, εN

signed again, εN. again, εN. εN. εN εN εN εNεNεN εWεWεW εWεWεW εWεWεW

a blank page. i have <a class="lyric" href="https://genius.com/Simon-and-garfunkel-the-sound-of-silence-lyrics">touched the sound of silence</a>

scribbles again. eyes. what is in my eyes that hurts you all so bad? a lack of vanity? the meaning of what i am feeling?

i have to rationalize it all. i have to rationalize it all, because i live in hell

the churches couldn't stop the rumors of wars, threats in <a class="lyric" href="https://genius.com/Pink-floyd-brain-damage-lyrics">the paper</a>. if the rumors don't stop, they become real. if the rumors are real, they don't stop. it becomes right to fear.

there's a jumble as the vision ends. "sapphic boyfriend jesus". "somewhere upstate on the fuckmarry kill". "the  in my eye". "zhənəsequa". "all conversations lead to the eye"
