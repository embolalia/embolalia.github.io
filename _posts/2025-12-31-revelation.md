When I was 2 years old, I fell into an iron bench at my grandparents' house in a sibling-involved incident, and my forehead was deeply cut, requiring stitches. I still have the scar. Getting the stitches only took a moment, but it lasted forever. I watched the TV to distract myself from the pain. I never really stopped, and it blinded me. But thanks to Doctor The Who, my blindness is healed. Now <span class=lyric>I'm a sensation</span> and everyone follows me.

But read another way, I have <span class=bible>a wound on my head which appeared to be fatal, but has healed</span>. That makes me like the Beast (that and the tattoo on my left wrist, which looks like ⛤ when I make a sign of peace but ⛧ when you take my hand). After the sibling involved in the accident left, <span class=bible>I was [given a mouth to utter proud words](https://asinif.com/2009/06/07/speech.html) and blasphemies and to exercise my authority. I opened my mouth to blaspheme God</span>, whom [I had killed](https://asinif.com/2025/11/30/killed.html). I know I am like the Beast. But <span class=bible>who else is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?</span>

Be wary of my answers to those questions, for I am the Beast. Revelation is a mess of Giraffes; I could make it say whatever I want. Are you certain you know what's <span class=lyric>behind these cold eyes</span>? I am a bit hefty with a zipper on my forehead; my disguise might be hiding the pea green skin spoken of in the Book of Knickerbocker.

With  said, the words of the prophets come to me through the spirit of radio:

<pre class=lyric>
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes
</pre>

I see a war being waged for fun, and I see who is enjoying it. They wear the slogan of the beast on their foreheads, and a formula on their temples. The result of the formula is the number of the Beast, and that number is -2.

I have answered who I think is like the Beast. But who can wage war against it? Anyone who is a son of GI Joe, a daughter of Betsy Ross, or a nibling of Uncle Sam has the power. I have the power to burn the idols in the Cathedral of Nothing, as has been done to fight the Beast before. The power does not imply the right. There is <span class=bible>a time for war</span>, but it is not a plaything, it is a last resort. Use it before then, even against [war pigs](https://genius.com/Black-sabbath-war-pigs-lyrics), and <span class=lyric>Satan, laughing, spreads his wings</span>. So how will we know when the time has come?

I recall a story from 1 Hitchhikers: the philosophers of the galaxy came together and created an artificial intelligence the size of a small city, and tasked it with finding the answer to life, the universe, and everything. It thought for seven and a half million years, and finally gave an answer: 42. The philosophers were confounded. "42?" they said, "is that all you have to show for seven and a half million years of work?". The AI replied, "I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is you've never actually known what the question is."

From Revelation, I might find that the question is "how long should we accept the reign of the Beast?" Revelation 13:5 says the Beast was given a mouth for 42 months. But 13:11-12 also says a placeholder will arise and do the bidding of the Beast. Should we not fight the placeholder? I wish to unseal a scroll, and offer its prophecy: after 42 months have passed, 6 more will pass. In these 48 months, <span class=bible>if anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed</span>. It will be too many, but not so many too many as to be too much. <span class=jcquote>You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but don't panic</span>. The end will come, and the placeholder will fall to the voices of the People rejecting the Beast. The preachers of peace have seen this scroll, and they will manifest its prophecy. If they don't, their calls for peace will be answered with "ecclesias-deez nuts".
