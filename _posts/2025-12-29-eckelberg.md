doctor eckleberg looked into the windows. he shone a flashlight bright as a thousand suns. he looked at every light, every outlet, every wire; every faucet, every radiator, every pipe. he didn't see the furniture, or what was on the shelves. he took control of the switches and thermostats, optimized them just how he would want them. but he didn't live there. doctor eckleberg looked into the windows, but he didn't see the soul.
