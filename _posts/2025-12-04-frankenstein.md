it came up over dinner. I felt nothing. next session sobbing "I felt nothing". blinding pain. God, let me feel nothing. I see the scar. I felt nothing. look at the tv, not the surgeon. I felt nothing. an accident, forgive and forget. I felt nothing. I felt nothing. eye feel nothing.

� walked across the scarlet zee. the devils have left for memphis. let them go. have sympathy for them, and they might return as angels.
