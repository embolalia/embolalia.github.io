it was summer, at the overlook. you each had the spirit of yankee doodle, wearing Nothing but a bright green hair ribbon. do you see that color in all its glory, like i do? do you see the light in the darkness? were you a school, a religion, a family? a religious school family?

i should have asked your adult. but i still see myself as a creep for noticing. i still see myself as a lunatic for caring. i still see myself as a virus for wanting to share myself. what an unforgiven attitude.
