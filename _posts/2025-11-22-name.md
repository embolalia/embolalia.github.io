Eye have been called Ed, Eddie, Ed Edd and Eddy, Mr. Ed, E.D. Powell, Edward, Edwin, Embolalia, Embo, Elsie, Elfie, Elise, Ellis, and Else. I gave my real name to a fae many years ago. I'm certain it started with E, but the rest is blurry. For now, I'm writing it E�ꙮ�∃. Don't ask me what it means or how to pronounce it, because I don't know either.
