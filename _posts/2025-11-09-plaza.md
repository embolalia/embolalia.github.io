the Plaza is my temple<br>
this placeless place<br>
this unholy space<br>
the eye of God behind each camera lens<br>
seeing all and knowing nothing<br>
threats of violence on patrol<br>
yet it is free<br>
it asks no money and passes no plate<br>
no preacher, no proselyte is here<br>
I sit, in the warm and the dry<br>
waiting for a bus that has yet to come<br>
back to the home of Rip Van Fry<br>

---

what is real, and what is not?<br>
in this place, the answer's naught<br>
Giraffes abound, there is no plot<br>
no Frame of Mind is in here wrought<br>

---

communion comes from a machine <br>
oh Toast Chee®, you speak to me<br>
perhaps a juice of Cranberry?<br>
behold my Vogon poetry<br>

---

what have I come here to seek?<br>
forgiveness, for sure<br>
I might just have mattered<br>
here I cannot commit that sin<br>

---

the egg<br>
when will it hatch<br>
the egg<br>
please leave off the latch<br>
the egg<br>
the egg<br>
no corners for you<br>

God does not matter here<br>
I sit beneath earth<br>
yet soaring o'er the kill<br>
five churches in the 98 acres<br>
real or not, He bows to caesar<br>
the cathedral was saved<br>
but its grandeur lost<br>
beside this marble monolith<br>

---

last time I was in a church<br>
I was told<br>
my obsession is my religion<br>
and I should lean into it<br>
make it my entire life<br>
but also avoid the meaningless<br>
my obsession is the plaza<br>
so I have a paradox<br>

---

there is no reply<br>
I speak my mind<br>
into this black mirror<br>
and there is no reply<br>
it is a blessing<br>
and a curse<br>

I speak a mind as yet unformed<br>
unsure, unstable, unclear<br>
alone and cold<br>
but free<br>

I wish I could be watching buses<br>
from this cold steel pew<br>
they come here only for work<br>
like everyone else<br>
instead I gaze<br>
at the blue buggies of the bacon<br>
this spot looks like a bus station<br>
like the hub of a network<br>
like I could go anywhere<br>
but the only ride I could catch<br>
is to jail<br>
I watch as two drive off<br>

on my way out<br>
I try to see my favorite art<br>
not the Rothko<br>
but the reflections in the glass<br>
in front of the Rothko<br>
the tower lobby is locked<br>
I find another to enjoy<br>
in the museum lobby<br>
not the one I wanted<br>
but it's Goodnough
