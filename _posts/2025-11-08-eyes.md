Eye've met you before. I don't remember your first name, but your last is written in your eyes. I haven't met you before, but I see whose eyes you have. there's a group of eyes I don't recognize.

your eyes are behind glasses; are they like mine? yours aren't anymore; are they like mine? or is vanity selling your soul to tj Eckleberg?

I am surrounded by a wheel of eyes. all of them will meet mine, but there are some i struggle to meet. eye know why. I want to say, but my tongue is still glued to the roof of my mouth. I don't know how to say it without leaning on the words of a God I don't technically believe in.

glasses imprisoned me. make your own choices, but promise me: honor the sabbath, and keep it dark.
