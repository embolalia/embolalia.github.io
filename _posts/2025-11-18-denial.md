i am in denial. i am in denial of my flesh, denial of my vision, denial of my voice. i do not deny the sin of denial, thus to your denial i cast not stones but spells. i have talked with the darkness as prophets do. hear my words that i might teach you: there is a time for accord and a time for dissent, a time for religion and a time for science, a time to be holy and a time to sin. the spectrum of nuance is more than even my old friend can teach. but do not deny it, adelphoi, or i cannot be your keeper
