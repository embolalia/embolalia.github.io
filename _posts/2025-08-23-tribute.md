I haven't been sleeping, because I've been having a dream. Last night, in the new moon, the dream crystallized. In a flash of green glory my Giraffes, � and �, showed me the future.

We the People were gathered on the hills and plains and mounts, joined by everyone's Giraffes. All our lights went out as the horns sounded the fanfare of the Journey. An orchestra then played the song of Hope as we saw our stars in their own light.

Then a Historical Document scrolled across the sky. As it ended I heard a whistle of Tribute in the wind. This vision will manifest in 2063, and all the organs and all the choirs will sing out the song of Joy.

My Giraffes then showed me the real Document, and I knew it was the greatest document in the world. It had no one language, no one form, no one meaning. It read the same, and differently, left to right and right to left, upside down and backwards. It was short enough to read quickly, but too nuanced to be brief. It appeared to me as an ordered list, but that is just how my Lobes interpreted it; it had no inherent order. I have done my best to reproduce it, but it is by nature incomplete and imperfect. This is not the greatest document in the world. This is just a Tribute.
