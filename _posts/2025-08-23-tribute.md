Elicha Knickerbocker was struggling to sleep, because they were having a dream. One night, in the new moon, the dream crystallized. In a flash of green glory they were visited by two Giraffes. One was Joseph Smith, and the other was their ancestor Diedrich. They showed him the future.

We the People were gathered on the hills and plains and mounts, joined by everyone's Giraffes. All our lights went out as the horns sounded the fanfare of the Journey. An orchestra then played the song of Hope as we saw our stars in their own light.

Then a Historical Document scrolled across the sky. As it ended, Elicha heard a whistle of Tribute in the wind. They knew that this vision has manifested in 2063, and all the organs and all the choirs have sung out the song of Joy.

Their Giraffes then showed them the real Document, and they knew it was the greatest document in the world. It had no one language, no one form, no one meaning. It read the same, and differently, left to right and right to left, upside down and backwards. It was short enough to read quickly, but too nuanced to be brief. It appeared to them as an ordered list, but that is just how their Lobes interpreted it; it had no inherent order. They did their best to reproduce it, but it is by nature incomplete and imperfect. This is not the greatest document in the world. This is just a Tribute.
