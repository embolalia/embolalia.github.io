<span class=lyric>
Though below me, I feel no motion<br/>
Standing on these mountains and plains<br/>
Far away from the rolling ocean<br/>
Still my dry land heart can say<br/>
I've been sailing all my life now<br/>
~~Never harbor or port have I known~~<br/></span>
<span class=scifi>The wide universe is the ocean I travel<br/>
And the earth is my blue boat home</span>
