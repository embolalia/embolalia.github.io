My imaginary friend Elicha Knickerbocker died on new year's eve, along with Everyone Else. <span class=lyric>He blew his brains out into the bay</span>. He gave me these words to say, as I spread his ashes at the landing:

<blockquote>
<span class="jc lyric">
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall<br/>
like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall<br/>
and so it seemed to confess…<br/>
</span><br/>

<span class="jc bible">
Wars and rumors of wars?<br/>
Sexual immorality?<br/>
</span><br/>

<span class="jc scifi">
Don't panic.<br/>
</span><br/>

<span class="jc scrawl">
pray
</span>
</blockquote><br/>

I left a cross in the snow, by a bench that said "music is enough for a lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music". I think I know how to bring Everyone back. This 6/7, Everyone needs to laugh. But to do that, <span class=lyric>utusamehe makosa yetu, kama nasi tunavyowasamehe waliotukosea</span> and <span class=lyric>hasa diga eebowai</span> can't be foreign.
