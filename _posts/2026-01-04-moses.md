```
the chain speaks to me
resin from the rash tree
do not touch
there are handprints in the dust
what beautiful Lunatic created this Art?


the Bush was a bramble
full of thorns
don't stick your hand in there
it'll hurt, like fire
but it is what it is

it told him the ground was holy
it won't burn him
he should take off his sandals
feel the warm sand between his toes
instead of standing on them

he had eyes of Vision 
wild, staring eyes
eyes that saw darkness
eyes imprisoned behind a veil
eyes that saw a truth, and called it �
